This Chart reveals an important trend of how the child mortality rate have been changing across the years. 
This gives us a very important insight on how the present developed countries have successfully reduced the rate, and underdeveloped countries still faces challenges to curb child mortality successfully.
We can utilise the trends in the graph to understand the factors which might be the responsible for high mortality or low mortality. 
This will help the policymakers in developing/under-developed countries to develop data-driven policy to reduce child mortality.

st.write("""I began by acquiring a dataset on child mortality rates, with countries as rows and years as columns. The dataset contained child mortality rates as the number of deaths per 1,000 live births.
To make the dataset suitable for visualization, I transformed it into a long format using pandas.melt(), creating three columns: country, year, and mortality_rate. This step allowed for efficient filtering and visualization.
I chose a choropleth map because it effectively communicates regional differences using a color gradient. Each country is color-coded based on its mortality rate for a selected year, offering immediate visual insights.
I implemented a slider widget for year selection, enabling users to dynamically explore mortality rates over time.
This required ensuring that the year column was properly formatted as numeric data, and filtering the dataset based on the sliderâ€™s value.""")
