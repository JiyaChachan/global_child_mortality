https://huggingface.co/spaces/jiyachachan/fp2

🌟 **Overview**

This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that provides an in-depth analysis of global child mortality trends. The app visualizes data from the Gapminder Foundation, allowing users to explore the relationship between child mortality, life expectancy, population, and daily income across multiple countries and time periods.

The goal of this project is to provide a data-driven tool for understanding global health disparities and for informing policy decisions aimed at reducing child mortality in developing regions.
